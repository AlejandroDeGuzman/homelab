# 🏠 Homelab

This repository documents my personal homelab setup.

It contains configuration files, setup notes, and documentation for the services and infrastructure I run at home. The goal of this homelab is to reduce reliance on Big Tech platforms by using alternative, open-source, and self-hostable solutions, while also serving as a hands-on learning environment.

This repo acts as a living reference for how my homelab is designed, configured, and maintained, and will evolve over time as new services are added or existing ones are improved.
